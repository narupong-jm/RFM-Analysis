# RFM-Analysis
RFM analysis stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. It's a marketing technique used to understand and segment your customer base based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing these three factors, you can identify your most valuable customers and tailor your marketing efforts accordingly.

- Recency: This refers to how recently a customer made a purchase. Customers who purchase more recently are generally considered more valuable as they're more likely to be engaged with your brand and make repeat purchases.

- Frequency: This refers to how often a customer makes purchases. Customers who buy frequently are valuable as they contribute significantly to your overall revenue.

- Monetary Value: This refers to how much money a customer spends on average with your business. Customers who spend more per purchase are considered more valuable.

RFM analysis typically assigns scores (e.g., 1-5) to each customer based on their performance in each category. These scores are then combined to create a customer profile. For example, a customer with a high recency score, a high-frequency score, and a high monetary value score would be considered a "champion" customer, while a customer with low scores in all categories might be considered a "lost cause."
